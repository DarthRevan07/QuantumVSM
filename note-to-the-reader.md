Respected Sir/Ma'am, 
Due to the task deadline falling between my Mid-Semester exams, i could not devote the required time to the task at hand. Nevertheless, i have attempted to succeed at the task to the best of my abilities. 
I got to learn a huge array of new concepts and will surely work towards mastering them in the future. 
Completing this task was a great learning opportunity. I got to interact with my peers and expand my cognitive arsenal.
I came across some interesting reasearch on Quantum Kernels, and generating feature maps by (Altares-Lopez et al).

If selected as a mentee, i promise to devote myself completely to the task assigned and fill up any loopholes in my skillset.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Thanking You
Yours Sincerely
Tanmay
